# Unified School Coordinates — Philippine Schools

Reproducible pipelines that consolidate school geolocation data from multiple DepEd sources into canonical coordinates tables for Philippine public and private schools.

## Problem

DepEd maintains school coordinates across multiple systems that frequently disagree — sometimes by kilometers. School IDs also change over time (e.g., when a school's curricular offering is reclassified), making it difficult to track the same physical school across datasets. There is no single authoritative source for public schools, and the only private school coordinate source is self-reported with significant quality issues.

## Solution

Two separate pipelines address the distinct challenges of each sector.

### Public Schools

1. **Normalizes** five coordinate sources into a common schema
2. **Resolves historical school ID changes** via a crosswalk built from official mappings and spatial+name deduplication
3. **Selects coordinates** through a trust-based priority cascade reflecting DepEd's valuation of each source
4. **Falls back** to the next-priority source when the primary coordinate is flagged suspect (wrong municipality or outside all land polygons)
5. **Expands the school universe** using enrollment data to include schools with active enrollment but no geolocation data
6. **Attaches administrative location columns** (region, province, municipality, barangay) from the best available source
7. **Tracks lineage** so every coordinate can be traced back to its origin

### Private Schools

1. **Cleans self-reported coordinates** (fixes swapped lat/lon, rejects invalid and out-of-bounds values, flags suspect patterns)
2. **Merges** cleaned coordinates with the official LIS universe to ensure complete coverage
3. **Preserves GASTPE participation flags** (ESC, SHS VP, JDVP) for policy analysis
4. **Tracks cleaning status** so every coordinate carries its provenance

### Architecture

The project uses a medallion layout:

- **Bronze** (`data/bronze/`) — raw DepEd source files, original filenames preserved. Partitioned into `frozen/` (one-off snapshots) and `live/` (expected to refresh).
- **Silver** (`data/silver/`) — preprocessed, normalized parquets with standardized filenames; a stable contract between DepEd's noise and the cascade algorithm.
- **Gold** (`data/gold/`) — canonical published outputs consumed by downstream projects.
- **Reference** (`data/reference/`) — external reference data (the PSA barangay shapefile used for spatial validation).

Each loader module has a `preprocess()` function (bronze → silver) and a `read_silver()` function (silver → memory). The cascade, crosswalk, and validation algorithms read silver only.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Python 3.11+ with `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `pyarrow`, `numpy`, `geopandas`, `shapely`.

### Full rebuild

```bash
cd project_coordinates/
python scripts/build.py --stage=all
```

Stages:
- `--stage=silver` — preprocess bronze → silver only
- `--stage=gold` — silver → gold (assumes silver already exists)
- `--stage=all` — full rebuild (default)

Both pipelines are deterministic and re-runnable. Outputs are regenerated from the raw DepEd source files in `data/bronze/`.

### Rebuild with verification

```bash
bash scripts/rebuild_and_verify.sh
```

Runs the full rebuild, diffs the new metrics against the previous run, runs the regression test suite, and prints a single `PASS` / `REGRESSION` line. Exit 0 iff build and tests both succeed. Recommended after any change to `data/bronze/`.

### Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

46 regression tests covering `normalize_school_id`, swap-fix and PH-bounds helpers, crosswalk identity-preferred dedup (including the `101701` conflation scenario), suspect-coord detection, PSGC validation coord_status awareness, and preprocessor silver-schema contracts.

## AI Disclosure

This project was developed with substantial assistance from **Claude** (Anthropic), used as a collaborative coding and technical writing partner throughout the project lifecycle. AI was used for:

- **Pipeline design and architecture** — iterating on the priority cascade, crosswalk strategy, and modular structure through conversation
- **Medallion refactor** — partitioning `data/` into bronze/silver/gold/reference layers and splitting loaders into `preprocess()` + `read_silver()` functions
- **Code implementation** — writing Python modules, orchestrator scripts, and data processing logic
- **Data quality audits and fixes** — identifying silent cross-school conflation bugs (e.g. the `101701` case), designing tie-break rules that prefer identity mappings, adding cascade fallback for suspect-coord schools, and raising ambiguous-mapping warnings at build time
- **Regression testing** — authoring the test suite that pins critical decision points against future regressions
- **Build infrastructure** — structured metrics JSON emission, the metrics diff tool, and the rebuild-and-verify wrapper
- **Data exploration and analysis** — inspecting raw datasets, profiling coordinate quality, and diagnosing cross-source discrepancies
- **Documentation** — drafting pipeline plans, technical notes, schemas reference, and this README
- **Decision support** — evaluating trade-offs (e.g., crosswalk thresholds, coordinate cleaning pass order, cascade fallback policy, medallion layer gitignore policy)

All design decisions, domain context (DepEd source valuation, school ID behavior, GASTPE program relevance), and data interpretation were directed by the human author. The AI did not have independent access to external systems or make unsupervised decisions about data handling.

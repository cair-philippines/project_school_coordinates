# Silver — Preprocessed DepEd Sources

The silver layer sits between bronze (raw DepEd files, original filenames) and gold (canonical published outputs). Each silver file is the output of a loader's `preprocess()` function: a bronze file has been read, parsed, type-coerced, normalized, and written here as a parquet with a standardized filename and schema.

Silver is committed to the repository. Downstream consumers can read silver directly without having bronze files on hand.

## Regenerating

```bash
python scripts/build.py --stage=silver
```

This reads from `data/bronze/` and rewrites every silver file. The gold stage subsequently reads from silver only — it never reads bronze directly.

## Schema stability contract

Silver columns and dtypes are the contract between bronze loaders and the cascade algorithm. If a bronze file changes its schema, only the preprocessor changes; silver remains stable. Downstream projects that read silver can rely on this contract.

## Notes

- `enrollment.parquet` preserves ALL sectors including PSO. Callers that need to exclude PSO do so explicitly (`read_silver(sector="public")`, `load_full_metadata()`).
- `private_tosf_coords_stats.json` carries Pass 2/3 rejection counts that cannot be recovered from the parquet alone (rejected rows have their coordinates nulled).
- The `_was_swapped` signal column on coord sources is preserved through to silver.
